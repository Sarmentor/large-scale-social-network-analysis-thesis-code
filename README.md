# large-scale-social-network-analysis-thesis-code

Throughout this document we present an in depth study and analysis of very large scale social networks. Besides the explanation of how to use and install several tools available, we explain in detail the basis of these tools. 
Several algorithms will be used to give the reader knowledge of different tools and technique results. Using tools like Graphlab or using Hadoop and Hadoop Map Reduce based tools like Pegasus or Giraph we will compute some important metrics. We will also use an optimized tool for graph analysis, it is called Snap (Stanford Network Analysis Platform). Although this tool is not inherently a parallel computing one, it can serve as a reference for non parallel graph analysis software. Several metrics will be computed for several different size networks including a case study using data previously achieved from the CrunchBase databases. One of this particular Crunchbase network has relationships between technological companies and financial organizations. Another network is also derived from Crunchbase databases with relationships between persons and technological companies.  
Finally, using parallel computing paradigm, two distinct algorithms will be implemented, a community detection algorithm and also a similarity ranking algorithm. Both algorithms behavior will also be subject of studies with test networks.
